<section id="about">
    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I am a public health and data analyst with a strong interest in how evidence,
        policy, and operational decision-making intersect to shape health outcomes.
        I completed a Master of Public Health at Imperial College London, graduating
        with a distinction and specialising in Health Promotion and Service Improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
        My academic work focused on the wider determinants of health, particularly the
        role of commercial, structural, and environmental factors in shaping non-communicable
        disease risk across the life course. My dissertation explored the relationship
        between public transport infrastructure and cardiometabolic health outcomes,
        combining quantitative analysis with policy interpretation. I presented this
        work to academic and non-academic audiences and was later invited back to present
        the findings to new students and staff.
    </p>
    <p>
        What motivates my work is the belief that good data should lead to better
        decisions, especially where resources are limited and inequalities are entrenched.
        I am particularly interested in roles that sit between analysis, policy, and
        service improvement, where insight can directly inform action.
    </p>

<section id="projects">
    <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
    <p>
        Each project follows a simple structure: identifying a real-world problem,
        using data to understand it, and translating findings into practical insights
        for decision-makers.

<section id="career">
    <h2>Career & Professional Experience</h2>
    <p>
        Before moving fully into public health and analytics, I worked in healthcare
        workforce and recruitment roles that operated in close partnership with NHS
        trusts and independent providers. My work focused on supplying doctors and
        nurses into frontline services, often during periods of significant system
        pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
        I supported workforce delivery through major periods of change, including
        Covid-19, Brexit-related immigration shifts, and the implementation of GDPR.
        This required managing uncertainty, translating complex regulatory requirements
        into operational processes, and communicating clearly with clinicians, managers,
        and external stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        These roles developed my ability to prioritise competing demands, work with
        incomplete information, and communicate with impact. I regularly used structured
        approaches such as the Eisenhower Matrix for prioritisation and the Situation,
        Behaviour, Impact framework to support effective communication and feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
        This background informs how I approach data analysis today. I am less interested
        in analysis for its own sake, and more focused on producing insight that is
        timely, relevant, and genuinely useful for people making decisions in complex
        systems.
